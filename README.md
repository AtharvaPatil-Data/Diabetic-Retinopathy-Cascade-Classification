## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **multi-stage cascaded deep learning framework** for **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) classification** using a pre-trained **ResNet50** backbone.  
The approach improves both **early-stage** and **advanced-stage** DR detection by:
- Grouping visually similar DR stages.
- Refining classification in multiple cascade stages.

The model is trained and evaluated using **two public datasets**:
- **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection**
- **Diabetic Retinopathy Resized Dataset**

By combining datasets and applying a **Smooth Data Augmentation** strategy, this system effectively addresses **class imbalance** and enhances detection of subtle early-stage DR cases.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Cascaded ResNet50 architecture** for staged DR classification.
- **Dual dataset integration** for increased diversity and robustness.
- **Structured augmentation pipeline** (flip, brightness, saturation) for class balancing.
- **Detailed evaluation metrics**: class-wise F1-scores, precision, and recall.
- **Improved early-stage sensitivity**, critical for real-world screening.
