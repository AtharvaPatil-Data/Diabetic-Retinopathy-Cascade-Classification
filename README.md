## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **multi-stage cascaded deep learning framework** for **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) classification** using pre-trained **ResNet50**.  
The approach enhances early and advanced stage detection accuracy by **grouping visually similar DR stages** and refining classification through multiple cascade steps.

The model was trained and evaluated using **two public datasets**:
- **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection**
- **Diabetic Retinopathy Resized Dataset**

By combining datasets and applying a **Smooth Data Augmentation** strategy, this system addresses **class imbalance** and improves detection of subtle early-stage DR cases.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Cascaded ResNet50 Architecture** for multi-stage classification.
- **Dual dataset integration** for greater variability and robustness.
- **Structured data augmentation** (flip, brightness, saturation) to handle imbalance.
- **Detailed class-wise metrics** including F1-scores, precision, and recall.
- **Early-stage sensitivity** improvement for real-world screening.
