# ğŸ“‚ Processed Dataset Information

## Overview
This folder contains the **processed and augmented datasets** used for training and evaluation of the Diabetic Retinopathy Cascade Classification model.

The original datasets (**APTOS 2019** and **Diabetic Retinopathy Resized**) underwent:
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Cropping to remove black borders.
   - Resizing images to **224Ã—224** pixels.
   - Applying median filter to enhance small vascular structures.
2. **Smooth Data Augmentation**:
   - Horizontal flip
   - Vertical flip
   - Brightness enhancement
   - Saturation enhancement

This process was performed to:
- Address **class imbalance**.
- Improve **model generalization**.
- Increase dataset size for robust training.
